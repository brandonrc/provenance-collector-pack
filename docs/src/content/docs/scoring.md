<!-- GENERATED from docs/SCORING.md - edit that file and run: python3 scripts/sync-docs.py -->

All scores are 0–100 (higher is better). Grades: A ≥ 90, B ≥ 80, C ≥ 65, D ≥ 50, F < 50.

## Image vulnerability score

For each consensus finding (unique `(vulnId, package)` across scanners):

| consensus severity | base weight |
|---|---|
| critical | 10 |
| high | 4 |
| medium | 1 |
| low | 0.2 |
| negligible / unknown | 0.05 |

Multipliers:
- **Agreement**: 1 scanner = 0.6, 2 scanners = 0.85, 3 scanners = 1.0 (over scanners that
  completed successfully; if only one scanner succeeded, agreement multiplier = 1.0 and
  the image gets `confidence: low`).
- **Fixable** (a fixed version exists): × 1.25 (unpatched-but-patchable is worse).

`penalty = Σ base × agreement × fixable`
`imageVulnScore = 100 × exp(−penalty / 40)` rounded to 1 decimal.

Examples: 1 critical fixable, all three agree → penalty 12.5 → 73.2 (C). 5 highs agreed
→ 20 → 60.7 (D). 30 mediums → 30 → 47.2 (F). Clean → 100 (A).

If **no scanner succeeded** the image has `score: null`, `grade: "?"` and is excluded
from aggregates but counted in `images.failed`.

## Posture (configuration) checks

Each check has a severity weight: critical 10, high 4, medium 1, low 0.2. Evaluated per
container (or per pod where noted).

| id | sev | rule |
|---|---|---|
| privileged | critical | `securityContext.privileged == true` |
| host-namespaces | critical | pod `hostPID`/`hostIPC`/`hostNetwork` true |
| host-path | high | pod has `hostPath` volume |
| run-as-root | high | neither container nor pod sets `runAsNonRoot: true` and `runAsUser` is unset or 0 |
| privilege-escalation | high | `allowPrivilegeEscalation` not `false` |
| added-capabilities | high | `capabilities.add` non-empty (NET_ADMIN/SYS_ADMIN etc. → critical) |
| capabilities-not-dropped | medium | `capabilities.drop` lacks `ALL` |
| writable-rootfs | medium | `readOnlyRootFilesystem` not true |
| no-resource-limits | medium | cpu or memory limits unset |
| no-resource-requests | low | requests unset |
| mutable-tag | medium | image tag is `latest` or missing and no digest pinned in spec |
| no-liveness-probe | low | long-running container w/o livenessProbe |
| no-readiness-probe | low | w/o readinessProbe |
| automount-sa-token | low | `automountServiceAccountToken` not false and SA is `default` |
| seccomp-unconfined | medium | seccompProfile type `Unconfined` or unset at both levels |
| no-netpol | low | namespace has no NetworkPolicy selecting the pod (per pod) |

`workloadPostureScore = 100 × exp(−Σ failed weights / 20)`.
Checks for `kube-system` pods are evaluated but weighted × 0.5 (system components are
expected to be privileged); they are flagged `systemNamespace: true`.

## Aggregation

- **Workload score** = 0.7 × mean(imageVulnScore of its containers' images, running only)
  + 0.3 × workloadPostureScore.
- **Namespace score** = container-weighted mean of workload scores (more replicas = more
  exposure).
- **Supply-chain score** per image (DESIGN §12): start 100; −40 unsigned (−20 signed but unverified),
  −20 no SBOM, −15 no provenance, −15 update available (−25 if a major version behind), −10 mutable tag
  without digest pin; floor 0. `supplyChainScore` = container-weighted mean over running containers.
- **Cluster score** = 0.6 × `vulnScore` + 0.25 × `postureScore` + 0.15 × `supplyChainScore`
  (before §12 ships: 0.7 / 0.3 with supply chain omitted), where
  `vulnScore` = container-weighted mean of imageVulnScore over all running containers with
  a scored image, and `postureScore` = container-weighted mean of workloadPostureScore.
- `grade` from the table above. Trend compares to previous completed scan.

## Scanner freshness

Each scanner reports `dbUpdatedAt`. If any enabled scanner DB is older than 72h, the
summary carries `warnings: ["trivy database is 5 days old"]`; it does not change the
score.
